## Research Interests

After a PhD working on reinforcement learning models for spatial navigation, Charline is currently working as a postdoc in Peter Dayan's laboratory. Her research interests revolve around uncertainty, decision making and cognitive control. One of her current projects focuses on analysing CA1 remapping patterns emerging from different types of reward uncertainty. Another ongoing project is within the international brain laboratory, in which she is working as a theorist, trying to find behavioural traces of cognitive control in the international brain laboratory task and their neural substrate, in particular in the anterior cingulate area.
